Homework#10 - Bamazon Inventory

 ```
Welcome to Bamazon! This is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. 

Within the customer portal, you can view the inventory, choose an item you'd like to purchase,
choose the quantity, and, if it's in stock, your transaction is completed! However, if we do not have enough 
of the selected item in stock for your purchase, the transaction won't go through.

In the manager portal, you can view all inventory in the store, view low
inventory (less than 5 items in stock), increase the inventory back to the correct amount
needed, and even add new items to your inventory! 

Happy shopping!
